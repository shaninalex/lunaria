Angular UI Components library

> The project in development stage and some features or even modules can appear or desappear from time to time.

This is a simple component library created for a small project in need of replacing the Angular Material Design 
library. The Angular Material library was not suitable for the project's purpose, as it was not configurable 
enough and was basically too large and complex.

Styles was havily inspired by Chakra UI.
